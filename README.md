# Hola Mundo! | Ciao Mondo! | Hallo Welt! | Bonjour monde!

Welcome to my Python Playground repository! This contains a humble collection of mini-projects of various themes, such as math, sorting, etc.
Have in mind this is an evergoing work-in-progress. As I learn more about the features and applications of [Python](https://www.python.org/) language,
I will be scattering pushes here and there of new things I come up with or find interesting. 

## About

- Each project is designed to demonstrate a concept in Python programming or code challenge.
- Files, functions and algorithms are (somewhat) documented with docstrings and comments to help understand their purpose.

## Play along...

Feel free to clone the repository to your local machine at will:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andresbonelli/Python-playground.git
